# Master-Micro-Software-Engineering-Intern-Task #
A couple of programming tasks before moving to the next steps.

# Task 01 : function plotter #
Following functionalities are implemented using MATLAB:
1. A GUI program that plots arbitrary user-entered function.
2. Take a function of x from the user, e.g., 5*x^3 + 2*x.
3. Take min and max values of x from the user.
4. The following operators must be supported: + - / * ^.
5. The GUI should be simple and beautiful (well organized).
6. Apply appropriate input validation to the user input.

The code with some screenshots are attached

# Task 02 : Topology API #
The following functionalities are implemented:
Provide the functionality to:
1. Read a topology from a given JSON file and store it in the memory.
2. Write a given topology from the memory to a JSON file.
3. Query about which topologies are currently in the memory.
4. Delete a given topology from memory.
5. Query about which devices are in a given topology.
6. Query about which devices are connected to a given netlist node in
a given topology.

The task was implemented using Spring Boot. Can be simply run with IntelliJ.
